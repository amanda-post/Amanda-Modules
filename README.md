# Arc'teryx Front-End Capstone - Amanda's Modules

> In this project, my teammates and I are creating a copy of an Arc'teryz web application page. We will be re-creating the aesthetics and interactivity of the page as accurately as possible--when someone opens our app, it should feel indistinguishable from the real thing. Except, in the case that we find something that we can optimize to improve performance.
